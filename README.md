# Emotion Detector

It is an appliation used to detect the facial emotions.

We have two features in our Application:

        - Live Detection
        - From Uploaded Images 

We had saved the trained model in the model_weights.h5 and the Architecture in model_a.json.

First, Install all the required packages mentioned in the requirements.txt file

```bash
  pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy pandas sklearn tkinter pil pil.imagetk
```


## Running the Program

Type the following command in the terminal

```bash
  python gui.py
```
Then select your Desired choice of Detection.

## Examples 

The following imags were used to test our program.

![Input 2](http://github.com/ritikranjan12/Emotion-Detector-using-TensorFlow/blob/ritik/t2.png?raw=true)

After passing in our program the output obtained is
